    detailedContent:
      "AR (Augmented Reality) navigation works best when your phone's camera has a clear view of your surroundings. Make sure to keep the camera lens clean and avoid covering it with your fingers. The system uses your phone's sensors to determine your orientation and position, so sudden movements can affect accuracy. For best results, walk at a normal pace and keep your phone relatively stable.",

    detailedContent:
      "Voice commands make navigation more accessible and convenient, especially when your hands are busy. The system recognizes several commands: 'How far' tells you the distance to your destination, 'Where am I' provides your current location coordinates, 'Next instruction' repeats the current navigation direction, and 'End navigation' stops the current route. Speak clearly and wait for the system to process your command before speaking again.",

    detailedContent:
      "While AR navigation is designed to help you navigate safely, it's important to maintain situational awareness. Don't rely solely on your phone screen - regularly look up to check for obstacles like stairs, doors, or other people. Be especially careful in crowded areas or near vehicle traffic. If you're walking in a group, designate one person as the navigator to avoid everyone looking at their phones simultaneously. In emergency situations, always prioritize real-world awareness over digital directions.",

      "GPS accuracy can vary depending on your environment. Indoor locations, areas with tall buildings, or bad weather can affect positioning accuracy.",
    detailedContent:
      "Global Positioning System (GPS) signals can be affected by various factors. Indoor environments often have poor GPS reception because satellite signals are blocked by roofs and walls. Urban canyons created by tall buildings can cause signal reflection and multipath errors. Weather conditions like heavy cloud cover or storms can also impact accuracy. For the most accurate navigation, use the system outdoors with a clear view of the sky. If you're experiencing accuracy issues, try moving to a more open area or restarting the navigation.",

Voice guidance provides audio directions and distance updates, which is helpful for users with visual impairments or when you can't look at your screen. The system supports high contrast visual modes for users with visual difficulties. Text-to-speech functionality reads out location names and instructions. You can adjust voice volume and speech rate in the settings. The interface is designed to work with screen readers and other assistive technologies. If you need additional accessibility accommodations, please contact support.",

      "Most campus buildings follow a logical numbering system. Odd numbers are usually on one side, even numbers on the other. Room numbers often indicate the floor level.",
    detailedContent:
      "Understanding campus building layouts can help you navigate more efficiently. Most buildings use a systematic room numbering approach: the first digit often indicates the floor (e.g., 201 is on the 2nd floor), and subsequent digits indicate the room position. Odd-numbered rooms are typically on one side of the hallway, while even-numbered rooms are on the opposite side. Main entrances usually lead to a central corridor or lobby with clear signage. Look for building maps near entrances, and remember that emergency exits are marked and can serve as orientation landmarks.",

    detailedContent:
      "AR navigation is battery-intensive because it continuously uses multiple device sensors and features. Your camera is active for AR overlay, GPS provides location tracking, the display stays on at high brightness, and various sensors monitor your orientation. To extend battery life: reduce screen brightness when possible, close background apps that aren't needed, enable battery saver mode if available, and consider bringing a portable charger for longer navigation sessions. The system is optimized to balance functionality with power consumption, but these steps can help extend your usage time.",

      "Different weather conditions present unique challenges for AR navigation. Rain or snow can obstruct your camera lens, making AR overlays less accurate - keep your lens clean and dry. Bright sunlight can make your screen difficult to see, so consider increasing brightness or seeking shade when checking directions. Cold weather can drain battery faster and affect touch screen responsiveness - keep your phone warm when possible. Windy conditions might make it harder to hold your phone steady for AR tracking. In severe weather, prioritize safety and consider using traditional navigation methods if AR functionality is compromised.",

Offices typically use blue markers with building icons, restrooms use green markers with appropriate symbols, food locations have orange markers with utensil icons, and emergency locations use red markers with warning symbols. Parking areas are marked in purple, while general facilities use gray markers. Understanding this visual language helps you quickly scan available destinations and find what you're looking for without reading every location name. You can customize these visual preferences in the settings menu.",
